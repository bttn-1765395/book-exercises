## This is my report!

This is the code we will look at in class. This
is just plain old Markdown that lets you render
text in **bold** or _italics_. However, you can
put in a block of R code, and the document will
show the code and the results!

```{r example, include = FALSE}
numbers <- runif(1:100)  # make random numbers
hist(numbers)  # show histogram of the numbers
numbers_mean <- mean(numbers) # get the mean
```

The mean of the numbers happens to be `r numbers_mean`

```{r other_chunk}
print(numbers)
```
## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
